## Description

Most maps contain the worst quality and boring custom music ever, and often, these maps use the same songs, that are just copies of the same file but in different folders. 
This pack attempts to fix all that by replacing those songs with HD versions whenever possible, or remixes, to bring a fresh musicz that hopefully make your gameplay experience even better. The idea is to also have unique songs each time, meaning that there will be no song duplicates, and each map will have its own unique music.


## Credits (sorry, this pack has been around since 2017. Wasn't planning on releasing it, and therefore there are no credits)

- Custom music from different sources, both official and random youtube remixes
- Pavel Perepelitsa (gamestartup.mp3 in HD)
- Garompa (editing, cutting and exporting)
